Erlang Language Specification
=============================

This repository contains a **draft** for an [Erlang][] language specification.

Current State
-------------

The draft is in its current state quite old and outdated, but it contains
lots of valuable information. The initial commit contains its state as of
February 1999. We publish the source for the draft in the hope that we in
collaboration with the Erlang community eventually will be able to produce
an official Erlang Language Specification.

[The original draft][] from 1999 is available in the download area at
erlang.org.

Build the Document
------------------

The draft is written using [LaTeX][]. In order to build the document you
need to have LaTeX tools installed on your system. If you type `make` in
the top level directory, the document will be produced as a Postscript
document.

Contributions
-------------

Contributions are very welcome, and will be handled more or less the same way
as [contributions][] to the [Erlang/OTP repository] are handled.
